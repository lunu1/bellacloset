          <p>
            Welcome to Bella Luxury Closet. These Terms &amp; Conditions (“Terms”) govern your
            use of our website and services, as well as any orders or sourcing requests placed
            with us. By accessing our site or confirming an order, you agree to comply with and
            be bound by these Terms.

          <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold">2. Orders &amp; Sourcing Requests</h2>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2">
            <li>
              All orders and sourcing requests must be confirmed in writing (via email or website
              communication) and will include the item details, final price, and any applicable deposit.
            </li>
            <li>
              For custom sourcing requests (items not currently in stock), Bella Luxury Closet leverages
              its global network and trusted relationships to locate each piece.
            </li>
            <li>
              In the rare event that an item cannot be sourced, your deposit will be fully refunded.
            </li>
            <li>
              Once sourcing is confirmed and we proceed with the acquisition, the deposit becomes
              non-refundable and will be fully applied toward the final purchase price of the item.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span className="font-medium">Order Confirmation:</span> All orders are subject to availability and confirmation.
              Your payment method may be authorized at checkout, but payment will only be processed (captured)
              once your item has been verified and confirmed by our team—typically within 24 hours. If an item
              cannot be confirmed, the authorization is released and you will not be charged.
